I have a passion for solving challenging problems, exploring new ideas and diving into prominent tech stacks. I am sociable, an effective collaborator and a fast learner. I started my coding journey in college at 17 years old. I have designed, developed and successfully launched a mobile app to solve group bill splitting at restaurants.

I'm also an archery instructor and I have an archery club. I also love playing music, crafting things, playing video games and learning random stuff.
